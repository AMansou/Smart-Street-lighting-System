# Smart-Street-lighting-System
The current lighting systems suffer from being
completely outdated and do not take advantage of many recent
technological advances in order to optimize energy efficiency,
running cost and make the system more environment friendly. To
achieve better lighting systems, a combination of sensors must be
used in order for the street lamps to be able to gain information
about the outside world such as light and motion around it.
The lamp nodes should also have the ability to process this
information, and use it or pass it along to the nodes as instructed
by the calculations of a remote server. The approach proposed in
this paper involves usage of sensors as mentioned earlier, making
use of a low power communication protocol (ZigBee) and using a
remote-control system which receives data from the lamp nodes
using the Ethernet protocol to effectively and remotely manage
street lights. Error detection mechanisms are also discussed and
implemented.
